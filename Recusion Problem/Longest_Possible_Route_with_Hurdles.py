#  Why the Difference Between visited and maxLength?
# visited:

# Tracks the state of the grid.
# It needs to be reset explicitly during backtracking because it is shared across recursive calls
# (i.e., itâ€™s passed by reference).
# Failing to reset visited[sr][sc] would incorrectly mark a cell as visited for all paths,
# preventing valid paths from being explored.

# maxLength:

# Tracks the length of the current path.
# Since itâ€™s passed as a function parameter
# (by value for immutable types like integers), 
# each recursive call gets an independent copy of the value.
# It doesnâ€™t need manual adjustment when backtracking.


#  here maxlength is integer so at the time of backtrackign it value  remain same  evem on next call . 
#  his value is increase or decrease. because it is pass by value. not pass by refrece. 

#  but visited  list is pass by refrece. so what ever changes happend in next call. while backtracking the changes will reflact. 
#  but not in the case of maxLength. 
# becasue it is pass by value not refrece. 

# Mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets) behave like pass by reference because changes to the object inside the function reflect on the original object.
# Immutable objects (e.g., integers, floats, strings, tuples) behave like pass by value because reassigning them inside the function creates a new object without affecting the original one.
